    "In supervised machine learning, we have access to both features and targets, this is not always the case. Sometimes we only know the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: We can not break up the sales of a grocery store by weather a shopper is a memmber of discount club or not using supervised machine learning, because we don't have a target to train and evaluate our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use unsupervised learning, to check the behaviour of the club members and nonmembers in the grocery store.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there will be two clusters of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of clustering algorithms is to identify those latent groupings of observations, which done well allow us to predict class of observations even without a target vector.\n",
